This report has a good explanatory part in the Introductory Section. That shows the reader has well renowned knowledge about the mentioned disease.
But there are some key points that are missing in this report and that can be improved further.
1) The Font Size & Heading Size must be same in the overall report.
2) The vey important part of the report "Table of Contents" is missing
3) The results are not well stated as true or false so the outputs of the given experiments is ambigious (Either your assumptions lead to truth)
Well! overall report is self-explanatory and good to go.
